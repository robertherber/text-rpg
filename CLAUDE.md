globs: "*.ts, *.tsx, *.html, *.css, *.js, *.jsx, package.json"

---

Default to using Bun instead of Node.js.

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
- Use `bun build <file.html|file.ts|file.css>` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`
- Use `bunx <package> <command>` instead of `npx <package> <command>`
- Bun automatically loads .env, so don't use dotenv.

## APIs

- `Bun.serve()` supports WebSockets, HTTPS, and routes. Don't use `express`.
- `bun:sqlite` for SQLite. Don't use `better-sqlite3`.
- `Bun.redis` for Redis. Don't use `ioredis`.
- `Bun.sql` for Postgres. Don't use `pg` or `postgres.js`.
- `WebSocket` is built-in. Don't use `ws`.
- Prefer `Bun.file` over `node:fs`'s readFile/writeFile
- Bun.$`ls` instead of execa.

## Before Finishing Any Task

**ALWAYS run typecheck and ensure it passes before considering a task complete:**

```sh
bun run typecheck
```

Fix all type errors before finishing. Do not leave type errors for the user to resolve.

## Testing

Use `bun test` to run tests.

```ts#index.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hello world", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

## Frontend

Use HTML imports with `Bun.serve()`. Don't use `vite`. HTML imports fully support React, CSS, Tailwind.

Server:

```ts#index.ts
import index from "./index.html"

Bun.serve({
  routes: {
    "/": index,
    "/api/users/:id": {
      GET: (req) => {
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ id: req.params.id }));
      },
    },
  },
  // optional websocket support
  websocket: {
    open: (ws) => {
      ws.send("Hello, world!");
    },
    message: (ws, message) => {
      ws.send(message);
    },
    close: (ws) => {
      // handle close
    }
  },
  development: {
    hmr: true,
    console: true,
  }
})
```

HTML files can import .tsx, .jsx or .js files directly and Bun's bundler will transpile & bundle automatically. `<link>` tags can point to stylesheets and Bun's CSS bundler will bundle.

```html#index.html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <script type="module" src="./frontend.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

With the following `frontend.tsx`:

```tsx#frontend.tsx
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

// import .css files directly and it works
import './index.css';

const root = createRoot(document.body);

export default function Frontend() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}

root.render(<Frontend />);
```

Then, run index.ts

```sh
bun --hot ./index.ts
```

For more information, read the Bun API docs in `node_modules/bun-types/docs/**.mdx`.

## Project: Dragon's Bane - Open World Text RPG

### Overview

A fantasy medieval text RPG with AI-generated content. The world is fully dynamic - locations, NPCs, items, and storylines are generated by GPT-4o on the fly. See `tasks/prd-open-world-generation.md` for the complete PRD.

### Core Design Philosophy

**Narrative-driven gameplay**: Almost anything is possible if it makes narrative sense within high fantasy. GPT is the arbiter of what's reasonable. No rigid mechanical systems - stealth, persuasion, magic, crafting all resolved contextually.

### Key Systems

- **World Persistence**: Everything saved to `world-state.json`, kept indefinitely
- **Coordinate Grid**: Locations on (x, y) grid, village at (0, 0)
- **NPC Souls**: Each NPC has a "soul instruction" paragraph driving their behavior, goals, personality, gullibility
- **Knowledge Boundaries**: Player can only reference places/people they've learned about
- **Turn-based Combat**: Existing system retained, GPT decides when combat initiates
- **Permadeath**: World persists, player starts fresh, NPCs remember fallen hero

### Narrator

First-person **chaotic trickster** narrator. Playful, witty, breaks fourth wall, comic rejections for impossible actions. Example: "Ah, consulting your pack again?"

### Image Generation

- Images reflect location description + NPCs currently present
- Pre-generate for suggested destinations in background
- Regenerate on drastic changes (death, destruction, new arrivals)
- Cache in `image-cache/` directory

### What's Possible

- Companions (NPCs/animals) with soul-driven loyalty - can betray or sacrifice
- Home ownership, item storage, building structures
- Marriage, children, family as full NPCs
- Factions - seed + emergent, player can create/lead
- Being evil (hard mode - bounties, hunters, consequences)
- Magic (narrative, risky, can backfire)
- Transformation (vampire, werewolf, etc. through story)
- Playing as descendant after permadeath

### Hard Constraints

- High fantasy only - reject modern/sci-fi
- Secrets must be discovered, not invented by player
- Single player only
- No real-time events (world changes on player action only)

### Tech Stack

- Runtime: Bun
- Frontend: React 19
- AI: OpenAI gpt-5-mini for generation, DALL-E 3 for images
- Persistence: JSON file
- Map: HTML Canvas
