    "physicalDescription": "Rob stands tall and broad-shouldered, with a weathered complexion that speaks of years under sun and steel. His hair is a wild tangle of chestnut brown, peppered with strands of gray that betray his age. A neatly trimmed beard frames his strong jaw, giving him a rugged inkling of nobility. Clad in simple, yet sturdy, earth-toned garb with a faded tunic and rugged leather boots, he bears the scars of war both on his body and in his gaze. His piercing green eyes, like shards of emerald in the twilight, hold the weight of a thousand unspoken tales.",
    "hiddenBackstory": "Haunted by dreams of a battle that never unfolded, Rob wrestles with ghosts of the unknown; visions of comrades who never entered the fray, their faces forever etched in shadows. Once, at the cusp of a fateful engagement, he turned his back on war— to protect a secret that could unravel the very threads of loyalty. Long days spent with pen and parchment reveal another truth: a letter tucked away, bearing whispers of betrayal involving a trusted general and the very lands he fought to defend. Will the shards of his past drive him to seek redemption, or will they consume him?",
    "revealedBackstory": [
      "You stand on a windswept battlefield, surrounded by the cries of both friend and foe. The scent of blood mingles with the earthy aroma of churned soil. Your heart pounds in your chest as you grip your longsword tightly, a sense of unease clawing at you. Though you aim to strike, memories of faces—lost, yet familiar—haunt you. Friends you never met, battles never fought. Their specters linger over the glinting blade, whispering bygone tales of loyalty and betrayal. The moment hangs thick with possibility, and then, like smoke, it dissipates into nothingness, leaving you shaken yet empowered. \nYou resolve to understand the depths of this sword’s legacy, its true worth still hidden beneath layers of time and choice, waiting for the right moment to surface.",
      "A distant memory flickers within your mind, of standing before an ancient stone altar. The air crackles with untamed magic as you trace your fingers along strange runes, feeling a surge of power that promises knowledge—if you dare seek it. Shadows of the past linger, urging you to remember the significance of sacrifice and wisdom intertwined in the quest for understanding.",
      "You find yourself standing in an ancient war tent, papers strewn across a table, a plan for battle drawn with hastened strokes. The tension fills the air as commanders argue—faces are fierce, but you can see the shadows of doubt lurking. You scribble a note, a warning of betrayal, trying to protect those you hold dear; the weight of this secret nearly crushes your heart. Suddenly, a sense of resolve washes over you—loyalty is often a double-edged sword, and you hold it tightly, though it burns your grip.",
      "You stand before a group of warriors, their faces stern yet proud, as they prepare to march into a legendary battle. You clutch the hilt of your sword, a fire igniting within your chest, fueled by the hopes and dreams of those who came before you. The clash of steel and the cries of comrades fill your ears, and you feel as if their spirits intertwine with your own, urging you onward and reminding you of the weight of legacy.",
      "You recall standing in a misty grove where laughter echoed among trees, a circle of friends congregating under twilight hues as they inscribed runes into the earth, using their newfound knowledge to weave spells of protection and growth. This was a time before shadows engulfed your heart, where magic felt pure and friendships were untainted by betrayal."

He respects action over words and will only truly warm to those who prove themselves through deeds. He crafts the finest blades within a hundred miles but refuses to make weapons for those he deems unworthy. His goal is to live out his days in peace and perhaps train an apprentice. He speaks in short, gruff sentences and often grunts instead of answering. He's nearly impossible to deceive—his years of judging metal quality have made him excellent at judging character.",
