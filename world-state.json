    "physicalDescription": "Rob stands tall and broad-shouldered, with a weathered complexion that speaks of years under sun and steel. His hair is a wild tangle of chestnut brown, peppered with strands of gray that betray his age. A neatly trimmed beard frames his strong jaw, giving him a rugged inkling of nobility. Clad in simple, yet sturdy, earth-toned garb with a faded tunic and rugged leather boots, he bears the scars of war both on his body and in his gaze. His piercing green eyes, like shards of emerald in the twilight, hold the weight of a thousand unspoken tales.",
    "hiddenBackstory": "Haunted by dreams of a battle that never unfolded, Rob wrestles with ghosts of the unknown; visions of comrades who never entered the fray, their faces forever etched in shadows. Once, at the cusp of a fateful engagement, he turned his back on war— to protect a secret that could unravel the very threads of loyalty. Long days spent with pen and parchment reveal another truth: a letter tucked away, bearing whispers of betrayal involving a trusted general and the very lands he fought to defend. Will the shards of his past drive him to seek redemption, or will they consume him?",
    "revealedBackstory": [
      "You stand on a windswept battlefield, surrounded by the cries of both friend and foe. The scent of blood mingles with the earthy aroma of churned soil. Your heart pounds in your chest as you grip your longsword tightly, a sense of unease clawing at you. Though you aim to strike, memories of faces—lost, yet familiar—haunt you. Friends you never met, battles never fought. Their specters linger over the glinting blade, whispering bygone tales of loyalty and betrayal. The moment hangs thick with possibility, and then, like smoke, it dissipates into nothingness, leaving you shaken yet empowered. \nYou resolve to understand the depths of this sword’s legacy, its true worth still hidden beneath layers of time and choice, waiting for the right moment to surface.",
      "A distant memory flickers within your mind, of standing before an ancient stone altar. The air crackles with untamed magic as you trace your fingers along strange runes, feeling a surge of power that promises knowledge—if you dare seek it. Shadows of the past linger, urging you to remember the significance of sacrifice and wisdom intertwined in the quest for understanding."
    ],
    "origin": "Rob hails from the weary lands of Rivermarch, a village nestled near the tumultuous borders of warring factions. After a lifetime spent retreating from battlefields and the incessant clamor of swords clashing, he now finds himself in Millbrook, seeking solace—or perhaps merely avoiding the shades of the past that whisper amidst the rustling leaves.",

Perhaps he is here to nurse old wounds, or perhaps it is the village’s charm that lured him—a siren’s song amidst the mundane hustle."
