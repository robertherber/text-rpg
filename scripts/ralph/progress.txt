## Codebase Patterns
- Use `Bun.file()` and `Bun.write()` for file operations instead of node:fs
- WorldState types are in `src/world/types.ts`
- JSON persistence files go at project root
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in codebase (index.ts, App.tsx, gameEngine.ts) - check new files individually with `bunx tsc --noEmit <file>`

## 2026-02-14 - US-001
- Created `src/world/persistence.ts` with saveWorldState() and loadWorldState() functions
- Uses Bun.file() for file reads and Bun.write() for file writes
- Files changed: src/world/persistence.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - World state types already exist in src/world/types.ts - well-defined WorldState interface
  - The codebase has pre-existing type errors that shouldn't block new feature work
  - Bun.file().exists() is async and returns Promise<boolean>
