# Ralph Progress Log
# Feature: Dialog & Map UI Improvements
# Branch: ralph/dialog-map-improvements
# Started: 2026-02-14

## Codebase Patterns
- Pre-existing type errors exist in index.ts, App.tsx, gameEngine.ts, imageService.ts - don't need to fix these for new features
- GPT prompts are in src/world/gptService.ts
- Frontend components in src/frontend/ with worldStyles.css for styling
- Map rendering uses HTML Canvas in MapPanel.tsx

## 2026-02-14 - US-001
- What was implemented: De-emphasized narrator text styling with italic gray (#6b7280) and kept NPC dialog in normal weight with standard text color
- Files changed:
  - src/frontend/StoryPanel.tsx - Added parseNarrativeText function to segment narrator vs dialog, added NarrativeText component
  - src/frontend/worldStyles.css - Added .narrator-text, .dialog-speaker, .dialog-text styles
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Narrative messages contain both narrator descriptions and NPC dialog (quoted text with optional speaker prefix)
  - Dialog pattern uses Name: "text" format or standalone "text" quotes
  - StoryPanel uses a "type" field to distinguish narrative/action/system messages
